To use JSXGraph, you need two files:

1. Link the file `jsxgraphcore.js` into your web pages. This file has been minified using the UglifyJS compressor. `jsxgraphcore.js` contains the complete source code of JSXGraph bundled in one file. All objects of JSXGraph use the namespace `JXG`. Beside `JXG` there are no global variables.
2. Include the css commands from `jsxgraph.css` into the web pages. It is available at <http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/distrib/jsxgraph.css>.

### CDN

The easiest way to use JSXGraph is to link directly to the public installation available through the Content Distribution Network (CDN) **cdnjs**. Put the following code into the `<head>` block of your document:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8"
 src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsxgraph/0.99.6/jsxgraphcore.js"></script>
```

The latest JSXGraph version hosted on **cdnjs** is:

* <http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsxgraph/0.99.6/jsxgraphcore.js>

### JSXGraph site
